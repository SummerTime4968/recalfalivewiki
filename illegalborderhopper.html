        <h1 style="font-family:helvetica">Trivia</h1>
        <p style="font-family:helvetica">Bart is left-handed, though sometimes he is seen using his right hand.</p>
        <p style="font-family:helvetica">In references to Greek mythology, Bart is always depicted as Hermes due to their many similarities. Both characters are depicted as tricksters whose mischief started on the days they were born (Hermes stole the cattle of Apollo during his infancy, while Bart set fire to Homer's tie at 10 minutes old). Both Hermes and Bart are thieves who rely on cunning to overcome their obstacles. They are also underdogs and have fathers with anger issues (Homer's anger is the most recognisable trait of the character and Zeus' anger is best embodied by the legend of Prometheus). On a lesser note, both Hermes and Bart are known to have supporting roles in stories; Hermes was known to help protagonists in their respective journeys while Bart frequently helps Homer in his schemes and often encourages his plans or comes up with ideas to make them more effective/selfish.</p>
        <p style="font-family:helvetica">Since Bart was born on April 1st, which is April Fools Days, he's had the reputation for pranking.</p>
